## Step 4

In this step we add following components to the system:
 - `Label` aggregate;
 - `Label`-related projections.
 
Also, the `Task` aggregate is now split into several `AggregatePart`s.

Finally, this step includes integration tests for the system.

### `Label` aggregate

`Label` is the second aggregate in the system. A label is a mark, which could be assigned to a task.

The state of the aggregate is defined by the [`TaskLabel`](./model/src/main/proto/todolist/model.proto) message type.

The [`LabelAggregate`](./api-java/src/main/java/io/spine/examples/todolist/c/aggregate/LabelAggregate.java)
is a good example of how to introduce custom default values for some fields of an entity state (in 
particular, the `TaskLabel.color` field).

### New projections

[`DraftTasksViewProjection`](./api-java/src/main/java/io/spine/examples/todolist/q/projection/DraftTasksViewProjection.java) and
[`LabelledTasksViewProjection`](./api-java/src/main/java/io/spine/examples/todolist/q/projection/LabelledTasksViewProjection.java)
are introduced into the system.

The `DraftTasksViewProjection` represents a list of all non-finalized tasks in the system.
As well as the `MyListView` projection, the draft tasks view is a singleton.

The `LabelledTasksViewProjection` represents a list of tasks marked with a given label. 
This projection type may have several instances.

Both added projections handle events produced by `Task` and `Label` aggregates.

### `Task` aggregate reformat

From now, the the `Task` aggregate is split into two parts:
 - [`TaskPart`](./api-java/src/main/java/io/spine/examples/todolist/c/aggregate/TaskPart.java) 
 represents the information about the task itself (e.g. description, due date, etc.);
 - [`TaskLabelsPart`](./api-java/src/main/java/io/spine/examples/todolist/c/aggregate/TaskLabelsPart.java) 
  represents the information about labels assigned to the task.

The parts are joined with the [`TaskAggregateRoot`](./api-java/src/main/java/io/spine/examples/todolist/c/aggregate/TaskAggregateRoot.java).

Both parts and the root have corresponding repositories registered in the TodoList bounded context.

This separation is performed with the purpose of isolating loosely coupled elements of
the aggregate. This may be useful e.g. when a client wants to fetch only a subset of all the data.

It is in general a good practice to split huge aggregates into several parts. Though, be aware of
eventual consistency when integrating the parts.

### Integration tests

The integration tests for the system are located in the [`integration-tests`](./integration-tests) 
module. See the [notes](./integration-tests/README.md) for more details on the tests organization 
and launching.
