/**
 * Serves as a repository provider for all the application components
 * that are initialized before the {@link BoundedContext}.
 *
 * <p> As long as the {@code Aggregate} and {@code Projection} repositories
 * require the instance of the {@code BoundedContext} for their own initialization,
 * they are all {@code null} before the {@code BoundedContext} is built.
 *
 * <p> However, some of the app components (such as {@link EventEnricher}) at the same time
 * <ul>
 *     <li> need repository instances for own operation, thus requiring them for instantiation,
 *     <li> are involved into the {@code BoundedContext} initialization.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In order to break such a cyclic dependency,  the instances of {@code TodoListRepositoryProvider}
 * serve as providers of the repository instances in "lazy" mode.
