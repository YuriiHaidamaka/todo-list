/**
 * An {@link AggregateRepository} which dispatches messages through a Kafka Streams topology.
 *
 * <p>Each subclass of {@code KAggregateRepository} starts a Kafka Streams processor upon
 * {@linkplain #onRegistered() registration} in a {@code BoundedContext}.
 *
 * <p>To enable the Kafka-based message dispatching, extend {@code KAggregateRepository} instead of
 * extending {@code AggregateRepository} directly.
 *
 * <p>All the commands, events and rejections dispatched to the repository are published into
 * a dedicated Kafka topic and then consumed by the repository itself. The Kafka processing
 * topology for this topic is built in a way that all the messages targeting the same
 * {@code Aggregate} instance are consumed by the same processor instance. Thereby no race
 * conditions happen when several messages targeting a single {@code Aggregate} are sent to
 * the system simultaneously.
 *
 * <p>The Kafka topic serving for this repository has the name of the Aggregate type name.
 * More formally, the name is equal to {@code repository.getEntityStateType().getTypeName()}, where
 * {@code repository} is an instance of {@code KAggregateRepository}. It's recommended that
 * the topic with such mane exists before the application start. It should have at least as many
 * partitions as there are instances of this specific type of {@code KAggregateRepository} in
 * the system. Also, consider having several replicas of the topic (i.e. set
 * {@code replication-factor} to a number greater than 1).
 *
 * <p>Note: once you define the number of partitions for Kafka topic, do not change it. This
 * constraint is connected to the way records are distributed among the Kafka topic partitions.
 * Once the partition number is changed, the instance applying the messages may also change,
 * causing race conditions and inconsistent states.
 *
 * @param <I> the type of the aggregate IDs
 * @param <A> the type of the aggregates managed by this repository
 * @author Dmytro Dashenkov
 * @see AggregateRepository for the detailed description of the Aggregate Repositories
